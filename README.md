Building From Source
--------------------

To build the project yourself, you must acquire your own copies of the necessary libraries:

 - The Canon EDSDK is available from Canon in your region. Currently we use version 2.10.0.10 of the SDK as more recent versions are buggy.
 - libjpeg-turbo is available from http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org
 - Syphon is available from http://syphon.v002.info
